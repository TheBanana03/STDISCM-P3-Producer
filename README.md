## STDISCM-P3 Producer Implementation
- The program requires its partner that can be found in the following github: https://github.com/Retraxi/STDISCM-P3
- Set the channel to http://localhost:5001 for testing within the same machine
- Otherwise, if using a VM like VirtualBox with Bridged Adapter
  - find the IP address of the host through the 'ipconfig' command
  - for the developers the Ipv4 address used was that of the Wi-Fi adapter
- Depending on what happens an inbound rule in firewall might need to be made at the port 5001 to allow for any
  traffic to come into it.
